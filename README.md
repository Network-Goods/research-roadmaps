# Research Roadmaps


> ðŸš€ Optimize scientific coordination for the creation of research public goods with positive societal outcomes. 


**Research roadmaps** are goal-centered graph representations of a strategy to achieve research milestones, enriched with quantitative data to make funding decisions, and select research pathways to drive deterministic progress toward a goal. 
They:
- sketch value flows in research networks, and highlight the paths of highest probability of impact and success,
- identify co-funders and research teams to drive impact, 
- highlight and de-risk points of attachment for bounties, Hypercerts, or retroactive funding.

We want to:
- make it easier for multiple groups to interact and collaborate via individual roadmaps, and connect research and product roadmaps to allocate resource and converge on the best research path to solve a problem that will lead to product improvements  in 6 months.
- build a shared network of research goals, milestones and dependencies to bootstrap research collaborations and foster alignment between researchers and research funders.
- bring the **open source mindset** to research roadmapping: promote immediate, continuous, and public sharing of research visions, goals and dependencies to enable others in the space to decide if, and how, they can collaborate or push othersâ€™ contributions forward. Roadmaps are supposed to be forked, adapted and merged, a dynamic instrument that adsorbs signals from any stakeholder who wishes to signal others and improve discoverability of science: whoâ€™s making or funding what, why, and whatâ€™s next.
