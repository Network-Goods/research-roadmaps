# Research Roadmaps


> ðŸš€ Optimize scientific coordination for the creation of research public goods with positive societal outcomes. 

Research roadmaps are collaborative decision-making instruments that outline the problem space and highlight promising routes toward a solution. They provide an iterable and shareable coordination platform to engage in distributed pathfinding and deploy incentives to push the scientific frontier forward.

We want to build a shared network of research goals, milestones and dependencies to bootstrap research collaborations and foster alignment between researchers and research funders.

**Actionable roadmaps** are goal-centered graph representations of a strategy to achieve research milestones, enriched with quantitative data, to make funding decisions, and select research pathways to drive deterministic progress toward a goal. They:
- sketch value flows in research networks, and highlight the paths of highest probability of impact and success,
- identify co-funders and research teams to drive impact, 
- highlight and de-risk points of attachment for bounties, Hypercerts, or retroactive funding.
